                    Knowledge is power. Knowing where your competitors succeed and where they fall behind in the eyes of<br/> their consumers is vital to building your own marketing strategy and improving your own product. This is<br/> why it's often important to monitor their brand almost as closely as you monitor your own. And the first<br/> thing to know is their brand sentiment. A sentiment analysis tool will answer questions such as: Do they<br/> get more positive or negative mentions? What are the negative mentions about? Can you reply to<br/> some complaints with your own offer? Doesn't hurt to offer an unhappy customer an alternative, does it?
